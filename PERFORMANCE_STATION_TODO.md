## 🔥 Critical Priority Metrics

### 1. Audio Jitter Analysis
**Weather Impact**: Storm intensity fluctuations  
**Technical Goal**: Measure timing inconsistencies in audio callback execution  

#### Implementation Details:
- **Test Method**: Record callback execution times over 1000+ cycles
- **Metrics**: 
  - Standard deviation of callback intervals
  - Maximum deviation from expected timing
  - Percentage of callbacks outside tolerance (±5% of buffer time)
- **Weather Metaphor**: Jitter = storm intensity variations
- **Scoring**: 
  - <1% deviation = Calm weather
  - 1-3% = Light breeze  
  - 3-5% = Windy
  - 5-10% = Storm conditions
  - >10% = Severe storm (unusable for pro audio)

#### Code Structure:
```cpp
class AudioJitterTest {
    void MeasureCallbackTiming(int numSamples = 1000);
    float CalculateJitterPercentage();
    JitterSeverity GetStormIntensity();
};
```

### 2. Thermal Throttling Detection
**Weather Impact**: Heat wave affecting system performance  
**Technical Goal**: Detect CPU frequency scaling under thermal stress  

#### Implementation Details:
- **Test Method**: Sustained CPU load while monitoring frequency
- **Metrics**:
  - Baseline CPU frequency vs. sustained frequency
  - Time to thermal throttling onset
  - Performance degradation percentage
- **Weather Metaphor**: Heat = thermal throttling severity
- **Scoring**:
  - No throttling = Cool mountain air
  - <10% reduction = Warm day
  - 10-25% = Hot day  
  - >25% = Heat wave (performance critical)

#### Hardware Integration:
```cpp
class ThermalMonitor {
    float GetCPUTemperature();  // Via /dev/misc/temperature
    float GetCurrentCPUFreq();  // Via system_info
    ThermalState AnalyzeThermalThrottling();
};
```

### 3. Audio Dropout Detection
**Weather Impact**: Lightning strikes (audio glitches)  
**Technical Goal**: Real-time detection of audio stream interruptions  

#### Implementation Details:
- **Test Method**: Monitor audio callback failures and buffer underruns
- **Metrics**:
  - Dropouts per minute
  - Average dropout duration
  - Recovery time after dropout
- **Weather Metaphor**: Dropouts = lightning frequency/intensity
- **Visual**: Lightning bolts in the weather view

### 4. Disk I/O Performance for Multitrack
**Weather Impact**: River flow rate (data throughput)  
**Technical Goal**: Measure sustained read/write for large audio files  

#### Implementation Details:
- **Test Method**: Simultaneous read/write of multiple audio streams
- **Metrics**:
  - Sustained MB/s for 24+ tracks at 96kHz
  - Random access time for project loading
  - Fragmentation impact on performance
- **Weather Metaphor**: Disk speed = river current strength
- **Thresholds**:
  - >500 MB/s = Rushing river
  - 200-500 MB/s = Steady flow
  - 50-200 MB/s = Slow stream
  - <50 MB/s = Stagnant pond

### 5. Network Latency for Collaboration
**Weather Impact**: Wind speed (communication delay)  
**Technical Goal**: Measure network performance for remote collaboration  

#### Implementation Details:
- **Test Method**: Round-trip time measurement to collaboration servers
- **Metrics**:
  - Ping latency to common music collaboration services
  - Packet loss percentage
  - Jitter in network timing
- **Weather Metaphor**: Network lag = wind interference
- **Integration**: Test connectivity to:
  - JACK network audio
  - Common cloud services
  - Local network (studio LAN)

### 6. Memory Fragmentation Analysis
**Weather Impact**: Fog density (memory efficiency)  
**Technical Goal**: Detect memory allocation patterns affecting real-time performance  

#### Implementation Details:
- **Test Method**: Allocate/deallocate patterns typical of DAW usage
- **Metrics**:
  - Heap fragmentation percentage
  - Largest contiguous block available
  - Allocation time variance
- **Weather Metaphor**: Fragmentation = fog thickness reducing visibility

**Weather Impact**: Cloud formation speed  
**Technical Goal**: Measure VST/plugin instantiation and scanning time  

### 8. Project Loading Benchmarks
**Weather Impact**: Sunrise timing (system wake-up speed)  
**Technical Goal**: Measure complex project load times  

### 9. USB Audio Interface Performance
**Weather Impact**: Atmospheric pressure (hardware connection stability)  
**Technical Goal**: Test various sample rates and buffer sizes with actual hardware  

### 10. Power Management Impact
**Weather Impact**: Eclipse effects (power saving interference)  
**Technical Goal**: Measure performance impact of power saving features
