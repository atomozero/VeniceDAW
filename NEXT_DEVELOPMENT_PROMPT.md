# VeniceDAW Phase 3.2 - Professional Audio Effects Implementation

## Context from Previous Session
We successfully completed Phase 3.1 Foundation with:
- ✅ AdvancedAudioProcessor framework implemented and tested
- ✅ 6/6 tests passing on native Haiku (99.2% validation score)
- ✅ Multi-channel support (Mono, Stereo, 5.1, 7.1, Dolby Atmos)
- ✅ Fixed Haiku compilation issues with -fPIC flag
- ✅ All changes pushed to GitHub

## Current State
The Phase 3.1 foundation provides stub implementations for:
- `ProfessionalEQ`: 8-band parametric equalizer (structure only)
- `DynamicsProcessor`: Compressor/limiter/gate (framework only)
- `SurroundProcessor`: Multi-channel spatial audio (basic implementation)
- `AdvancedAudioBuffer`: Complete multi-channel buffer management

## Next Development Phase: 3.2 - Implement Professional Audio Effects

### Priority 1: Complete ProfessionalEQ Implementation
Implement the actual DSP algorithms for the 8-band parametric EQ:
- Biquad filter coefficients calculation
- Per-band frequency, gain, and Q processing
- Cascaded filter implementation
- Real-time parameter updates without clicks/pops

### Priority 2: DynamicsProcessor Algorithms
Implement compression/limiting/gating:
- Envelope follower with attack/release
- Gain reduction calculation with knee
- Look-ahead buffer for zero-latency limiting
- Sidechain input support

### Priority 3: SurroundProcessor Enhancement
Enhance spatial audio processing:
- HRTF-based binaural rendering
- Distance attenuation and air absorption
- Early reflections for room simulation
- Doppler effect for moving sources

### Priority 4: Integration with Main VeniceDAW
Connect Phase 3 components to the main application:
- Wire AdvancedAudioProcessor into track processing chain
- Add UI controls for effects parameters
- Create preset management system
- Implement real-time metering and visualization

## Technical Requirements
- Maintain <5ms processing latency
- Support 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz sample rates
- Ensure thread-safe parameter updates
- Implement bypass with crossfade to avoid clicks

## Testing Requirements
Each implementation needs:
- Unit tests for DSP algorithms
- Performance benchmarks
- A/B comparison with reference implementations
- Real-time stress testing with multiple instances

## Files to Focus On
- `src/audio/AdvancedAudioProcessor.cpp` - Main implementation file
- `src/testing/AdvancedAudioProcessorTest.cpp` - Add algorithm tests
- Create: `src/audio/DSPAlgorithms.h/cpp` - Core DSP functions
- Create: `src/audio/FilterCoefficients.h/cpp` - Filter math

## Build and Test Commands
```bash
# On Haiku:
make clean
make test-phase3-quick   # Quick validation
./Phase3FoundationTest --comprehensive   # Full test suite

# For manual compilation if Makefile fails:
bash fix_haiku_build.sh
```

## Important Notes
- The foundation is solid - focus on implementing the actual DSP algorithms
- All stub methods in AdvancedAudioProcessor.cpp need real implementations
- Maintain the test-driven approach: write tests before implementing features
- Keep the same high standards: 95%+ test coverage, <5ms latency

## Success Criteria for Phase 3.2
- [ ] ProfessionalEQ processing audio with measurable frequency response
- [ ] DynamicsProcessor achieving target compression ratios
- [ ] SurroundProcessor creating convincing 3D positioning
- [ ] All tests passing with >95% coverage
- [ ] Integration with at least one track in main VeniceDAW

Start by implementing the ProfessionalEQ::ProcessBandFilter() method with actual biquad filtering.
