## Installation and Usage

### Building from Source
```bash
# Clone repository and navigate to project
cd HaikuMix

# Build Phase 4 Spatial Audio Mixer
make spatial

# Run the application
./VeniceDAWSpatial
```

### Quick Start Guide
1. **Launch Application**: Run `./VeniceDAWSpatial` on native Haiku
2. **Initialize Audio**: Application automatically configures optimal audio settings
3. **Create Spatial Scene**: Use the spatial controls to position audio sources in 3D space
4. **Real-time Mixing**: Interact with the 3D mixer view to adjust spatial parameters
5. **Professional Output**: Configure HRTF and environmental settings for final mix

## Development History

### Phase 3 Foundation
- Advanced spatial audio processing engine
- HRTF implementation with custom algorithms
- Environmental modeling and room acoustics
- Thread-safe parameter management
- Comprehensive test suite (72/72 tests passing)

### Phase 4 Integration
- Revolutionary 3D mixer interface design
- OpenGL-based real-time visualization
- Native Haiku GUI integration
- Professional workflow implementation
- Performance optimization for real-time use

## Performance Characteristics

### Audio Performance
- **Initialization Time**: <1 second on modern Haiku systems
- **Processing Latency**: 5.8-11.6ms depending on buffer configuration
- **CPU Usage**: <15% on quad-core systems for typical spatial scenes
- **Memory Footprint**: 50-100MB depending on scene complexity

### Graphics Performance

## Known Limitations

### Current Constraints
- Maximum 64 simultaneous spatial audio sources
- HRTF database limited to built-in generic profiles
- Environmental modeling optimized for small to medium rooms
- Real-time export limited to stereo and 5.1 formats

### Future Enhancements
- Custom HRTF profile loading
- Advanced environmental presets
- Network-based collaborative mixing
- Plugin architecture for third-party processors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Audio Initialization Failure
**Symptoms**: "BSoundPlayer init failed" error
**Solutions**:
1. Verify Media Server is running: `ps aux | grep media_server`
2. Check audio preferences in Media settings
3. Ensure no other audio applications are blocking the device
4. Restart Media Server if necessary: `/system/servers/media_server &`

#### Graphics Performance Issues
**Symptoms**: Low frame rate or rendering artifacts
**Solutions**:
1. Verify OpenGL support: Check for OpenGL add-ons in `/boot/system/add-ons/opengl/`
2. Update graphics drivers if using hardware acceleration
3. Fall back to software rendering if hardware issues persist
4. Reduce spatial scene complexity for better performance

#### Interface Responsiveness
**Symptoms**: Slow or unresponsive controls
**Solutions**:
1. Check system CPU usage during operation
2. Verify adequate RAM availability
3. Close unnecessary background applications
4. Consider reducing update frequency for lower-spec systems
