# VeniceDAW

A digital audio workstation designed specifically for Haiku OS, featuring native 3D spatial mixing and professional performance monitoring.

## üöß Project Status: Early Prototype

**Important:** VeniceDAW is currently in an early prototype phase. This is experimental software with many features still in development. Much work remains before it becomes a fully usable DAW. Consider this a technical preview and proof of concept rather than production-ready software.

## Vision

VeniceDAW brings professional audio production capabilities to Haiku OS, built around three core principles:

- **üîó Strudel Graph per track**: Modular FX chains ready to evolve into full node-based processing
- **üéõÔ∏è Cortex Integration**: Deep system-level routing through Haiku's BMediaKit architecture  
- **üåê 3D Audio as core feature**: Native spatial mixing with binaural processing and HRTF support

## Overview

Built from the ground up using Haiku's native BMediaKit, VeniceDAW provides powerful audio processing with intelligent system monitoring. The application showcases what's possible when software is designed specifically for Haiku's unique architecture rather than being ported from other platforms.

## Current Status: Performance Station

The **Performance Station** is the first component ready for use - a professional benchmark system that evaluates your Haiku system's audio processing capabilities using clean, intuitive interfaces.

### Features

- **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: CPU, memory, audio, and I/O metrics
- **Professional Interface**: Ableton Live-inspired design with clean meters and controls
- **Audio-Specific Testing**: Latency measurement, buffer processing, sine generation
- **System Analysis**: Multi-threaded CPU scaling, memory bandwidth testing
- **Export Reports**: Professional benchmark reports for system optimization

```

## Architecture

VeniceDAW is built on several core principles:

- **Native Haiku APIs**: Full integration with BMediaKit, BWindow, BView, Interface Kit
- **Real-time Audio**: Low-latency processing designed for professional use with BSoundPlayer
- **Modular Design**: Components designed around Strudel Graph architecture
- **Cortex Integration**: Built to work seamlessly with Haiku's system audio routing

### Core Components

- **Audio Engines**: 
  - `SimpleHaikuEngine`: Lightweight BSoundPlayer implementation
  - `HaikuAudioEngine`: Full BMediaKit integration with Cortex compatibility
- **GUI Applications**:
  - **VeniceDAW GUI**: Full mixer with 3D spatial visualization
  - **Performance Station**: Professional benchmark and monitoring
- **3D Spatial Engine**: Revolutionary spatial audio interface with OpenGL and binaural processing

### MVP Architecture Flow
